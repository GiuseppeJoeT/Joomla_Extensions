This folder contains all the Joomla Extensions I developed or projects where I contributed.

## Joomla Module - Latest Extensions Installed (Backend module)
Let's assume that you have a website that has multiple administrators
who maintain the content of the site and all of them have access to install new
extensions. 

As a super administrator, you'd like to keep an eye on what these other
administrators are up to, so you would like to have an easy way to see when new
extensions have been installed on the website.

The "Latest Latest Extensions Installed" Joomla module helps the Super User keep track of the last plugins, 
modules or components installed.

The module is developed with PHP 5.4 and MySQL 5.4.

Finally, the module follow the strict Joomla Framework rules and, as expected, it is designed through the
Model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern.
